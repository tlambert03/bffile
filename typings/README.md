# About the typings directory

This directory contains auto-generated type stubs for the Java classes used by
the bffile package. These stubs are generated by the `scripts/stubgen.py` script,
usually by running `just build-stubs` from the root of the repository (which
has the appropriate parameters to the script).

These are checked into source for convenience, but they are not intended to be
edited by hand.

The repo is currently tuned for usage with pyright: `uv run pyright`.
